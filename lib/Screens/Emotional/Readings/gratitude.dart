H2S, hydrogen sulphide; PEA, phenyl ethyl alcohol.\n\nRegarding externally rated dream emotions the statistical analysis yielded a marginally significant difference between the three conditions (F(2,18) = 3.6, P < 0.07), but two contrasts were significant (neutral versus negative: t(11) = 3.1, P < 0.01; negative versus positive: t(12) = 2.5, P < 0.02). Analysing the self‐rated dream emotions, the differences are more pronounced: F(2,18) = 6.2, P < 0.01, neutral versus negative: t(11) = 2.0, P < 0.04, neutral versus positive: t(9) = 2.7, P < 0.02, positive versus negative: t(12) = 2.9, P < 0.01).\n\nExplicit olfactory perception in the dream reports was scarce; i.e. in only one dream did the dreamer explicitly mention smelling something. Being part of a longer dream, the participant discussed with the experimenter why she did not wake her up more often because she had the impression of having dreamed more often. One of these dreams included a grinning Chinese woman who also looked disgusted because they (dreamer and Chinese woman) smelled something rotten. However, this dream was reported in the neutral condition. The statistical analysis (Fisher’s exact test) was non‐significant (P = 1.0). Four dreams included activities that are likely to be associated with olfactory perception in waking life: cleaning a toilet that was full of yellow liquid, eating a Kiwi fruit, eating potatoes with parsley and preparing a salad that included tuna, rice, corn and onions and being in a stuffy room. Again, the comparison between olfactory stimulation and control condition was not significant (Fisher’s exact test: P < 0.25). The matching task where the raters should guess what stimulus was present prior to awakening was not successful: rater 1 matched 13 dreams correctly and rater 2 matched 15. Given that guessing randomly would yield on average 14 correct guesses (33.3% of 40 reports), this is a chance finding.\n\nDiscussion\nOverall, the findings indicate that olfactory stimuli were processed by the sleeping brain and affect the emotions but were not incorporated explicitly into dreams. This is compatible with the model of specific processing of olfactory stimuli within the brain, i.e. the direct anatomical connectivity to the amygdala (Gottfried, 2006). Direct incorporations as reported by Trotter et al. (1988) or for other stimulus types (see Introduction) were not found, thus indicating that olfactory stimuli are processed differently to other sensory modalities on higher brain levels. Maquet and Franck (1997), based on the high activation of the amygdala during REM sleep (Maquet et al., 1996), proposed that the role of the amygdala is the processing of emotional memory. Given the direct connectivity of the olfactory bulb to this brain region, one might hypothesize that the emotional quality of the olfactory stimulus facilitates the processing of emotional memories with the same quality, i.e. the dream tone reflects the emotional tone of the stimulus but not the stimulus itself. Within this context, it would be interesting to pursue the idea studied by Saint‐Denys (1982), who reported that olfactory stimulation yielded dream reports including memories which were associated with this specific odour in a more systematic way and tested the link between emotional tone of odour stimuli and declarative memory. In a presleep learning session, positively toned and negatively toned odour stimuli could be paired with words or other declarative material. One would expect that after olfactory stimulation dreams would include this associated material more often. This follow‐up study would shed light on the psychological mechanisms underlying the present findings, i.e. whether the emotional tone of the olfactory stimuli might activate different sets of memories, including corresponding affects. Rasch et al. (2007) found that presenting a specific odour during slow‐wave sleep probably reactivates mental content which was learned during the day while the same odour was presented. It would also be interesting to study the effect of the emotional tone of other stimuli, e.g. acoustic stimuli such as words, on the emotional tone of dreams. We would expect that the effect would be much less pronounced than for odour stimuli because of the specific processing within the brain, but a sufficiently large number of trials should also result in a significant effect.\n\nThe differences of our findings in comparison to the earlier study by Trotter et al. (1988) indicated clearly that sophisticated technology in presenting olfactory stimuli is necessary, i.e. a technique without affecting the mechanical and thermal condition of the nasal mucosa, and that ensures that the odour is not detectable at the time of the awakening. With regard to these shortcomings, the results of the Trotter et al. (1988) study have limited generalizability.\n\nThat the lack of incorporated olfactory stimuli is explained by methodological issues (e.g. forgetting this part of the dream because it happened 1 min prior to awakening) is unlikely, because the procedure of the present study was comparable with the designs of similar studies in the field that demonstrated an incorporation of stimuli of other sensory modalities (cf. Schredl, 2008). On the other hand, it was necessary to test whether manipulation of presentation length or repetition frequency could increase the possibility of incorporation of the pure olfactory stimuli. However, the Stuck et al. (2007) study indicates clearly that \nREM awakenings\nThe participants were awakened by the experimenter who asked: ‘What was on your mind before I woke you up?’. After pauses in reporting, the experimenter prompted up to three times: ‘Was there anything else?’. Lastly, the participant was asked to estimate positive and negative dream emotions on 4‐point scales (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = strong feelings). For determining the emotional tone, the negative score was subtracted from the positive score. The interview was recorded and transcribed later. All words not related to the dream experience and repetitions were excluded. Mean word count was used as a measure for dream length.\n\nDream content analysis\nThe following scales were adapted from Schredl et al. (1998): realism/bizarreness (1 = realistic, 2 = realistic but extraordinary, 3 = one or two bizarre elements, 4 = several bizarre elements) and positive and negative dream emotions (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = strong feelings).

(1988) or for other stimulus types (see Introduction) were not found, thus indicating that olfactory stimuli are processed differently to other sensory modalities on higher brain levels. Maquet and Franck (1997), based on the high activation of the amygdala during REM sleep (Maquet et al., 1996), proposed that the role of the amygdala is the processing of emotional memory. Given the direct connectivity of the olfactory bulb to this brain region, one might hypothesize that the emotional quality of the olfactory stimulus facilitates the processing of emotional memories with the same quality, i.e. the dream tone reflects the emotional tone of the stimulus but not the stimulus itself. Within this context, it would be interesting to pursue the idea studied by Saint‐Denys (1982), who reported that olfactory stimulation yielded dream reports including memories which were associated with this specific odour in a more systematic way and tested the link between emotional tone of odour stimuli and declarative memory. In a presleep learning session, positively toned and negatively toned odour stimuli could be paired with words or other declarative material. One would expect that after olfactory stimulation dreams would include this associated material more often. This follow‐up study would shed light on the psychological mechanisms underlying the present findings, i.e. whether the emotional tone of the olfactory stimuli might activate different sets of memories, including corresponding affects. Rasch et al. (2007) found that presenting a specific odour during slow‐wave sleep probably reactivates mental content which was learned during the day while the same odour was presented. It would also be interesting to study the effect of the emotional tone of other stimuli, e.g. acoustic stimuli such as words, on the emotional tone of dreams. We would expect that the effect would be much less pronounced than for odour stimuli because of the specific processing within the brain, but a sufficiently large number of trials should also result in a significant effect.\n\nThe differences of our findings in comparison to the earlier study by Trotter et al. (1988) indicated clearly that sophisticated technology in presenting olfactory stimuli is necessary, i.e. a technique without affecting the mechanical and thermal condition of the nasal mucosa, and that ensures that the odour is not detectable at the time of the awakening. With regard to these shortcomings, the results of the Trotter et al. (1988) study have limited generalizability.\n\nThat the lack of incorporated olfactory stimuli is explained by methodological issues (e.g. forgetting this part of the dream because it happened 1 min prior to awakening) is unlikely, because the procedure of the present study was comparable with the designs of similar studies in the field that demonstrated an incorporation of stimuli of other sensory modalities (cf. Schredl, 2008). On the other hand, it was necessary to test whether manipulation of presentation length or repetition frequency could increase the possibility of incorporation of the pure olfactory stimuli. However, the Stuck et al. (2007) study indicates clearly that \nREM awakenings\nThe participants were awakened by the experimenter who asked: ‘What was on your mind before I woke you up?’. After pauses in reporting, the experimenter prompted up to three times: ‘Was there anything else?’. Lastly, the participant was asked to estimate positive and negative dream emotions on 4‐point scales (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = strong feelings). For determining the emotional tone, the negative score was subtracted from the positive score. The interview was recorded and transcribed later. All words not related to the dream experience and repetitions were excluded. Mean word count was used as a measure for dream length.\n\nDream content analysis\nThe following scales were adapted from Schredl et al. (1998): realism/bizarreness (1 = realistic, 2 = realistic but extraordinary, 3 = one or two bizarre elements, 4 = several bizarre elements) and positive and negative dream emotions (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = strong feelings). These scales showed good inter‐rater reliability ranged r = 0.642–0.825 (Schredl et al., 2004). For the purpose of the study, two additional scales were developed: explicit mention of perception of smelling something (present versus not present) and dream elements which are associated normally with strong odour (present versus not present). Lastly, for each dream report the judges should make a guess as to what kind of stimulus (positive, negative, neutral) was applied.\n\nProcedure\nThe participant slept for 2 consecutive nights in the laboratory. The first night served as adaptation to the setting including polysomnography and taped tube of the olfactometer. Stimuli (pleasant, unpleasant, neutral) were presented in a balanced order during the second night during each REM period. Stimulation (duration 10 s) was started after 5 min into the first REM period, 10 min into the second REM period and 15 min of all following REM periods. One minute after presentation, the investigator awakened the participant and elicited dream content and self‐rated dream emotions. Dream reports were taped, transcribed, randomized in order and rated by two independent judges along the rating scales described above. The judges were, therefore, blind to the condition and also not involved in the collection of the reports. Emotional tone (positive emotions − negative emotions) was used as variable for statistical analyses.\n\nStatistical analyses were carried out with sas version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Data were submitted to analyses of variance for repeated measures with ‘stimulus type’ as within‐subject factor. Contrasts were computed by dependent t‐tests. Degrees of freedom are presented in brackets following the F‐values and t‐values. The alpha level was set at 0.05.\n\nResults\n\nAll subjects were normosmic (mean TDI score 38.4 ± 5.1; range 33.5–45.0). No abnormalities were detected during the overnight sleep recordings of the first night. Because of the limited number of REM periods in several participants, 12 awakenings in the neutral condition and 13 awakenings in the positive condition could be carried out, whereas for the negative stimulus all 15 awakenings were performed. The time of night (measured as hours from midnight) was comparable across conditions and means were not statistically different (neutral condition: 4.37 ± 2.47 h, negative stimulation: 4.46 ± 1.39 h and positive stimulation: 4.02 ± 2.02 h). Dream recall was almost 100%; only one of 40 awakenings yielded no dream report, but for this participant the stimulation was repeated in the forth REM period.\n\nIn Table 1 and Fig. 1, the findings of the dream content analysis and the self‐ratings of dream emotions are depicted. Because of missing values, anovas were computed for 10 participants supplying dream reports in all three conditions. In order to maximize statistical power, all non‐missing values were included in the pairwise comparisons. Note that because of differences in the number of included cases, anova and pairwise comparisons might produce divergent results. Dream length did not differ significantly between the three conditions [F(2,18) = 0.1, not significant (NS)]. Similarly, realism/bizarreness scores were comparable (F(2,18) = 0.0, NS).\n\nTable 1.

Analysing the self‐rated dream emotions, the differences are more pronounced: F(2,18) = 6.2, P < 0.01, neutral versus negative: t(11) = 2.0, P < 0.04, neutral versus positive: t(9) = 2.7, P < 0.02, positive versus negative: t(12) = 2.9, P < 0.01).\n\nExplicit olfactory perception in the dream reports was scarce; i.e. in only one dream did the dreamer explicitly mention smelling something. Being part of a longer dream, the participant discussed with the experimenter why she did not wake her up more often because she had the impression of having dreamed more often. One of these dreams included a grinning Chinese woman who also looked disgusted because they (dreamer and Chinese woman) smelled something rotten. However, this dream was reported in the neutral condition. The statistical analysis (Fisher’s exact test) was non‐significant (P = 1.0). Four dreams included activities that are likely to be associated with olfactory perception in waking life: cleaning a toilet that was full of yellow liquid, eating a Kiwi fruit, eating potatoes with parsley and preparing a salad that included tuna, rice, corn and onions and being in a stuffy room. Again, the comparison between olfactory stimulation and control condition was not significant (Fisher’s exact test: P < 0.25). The matching task where the raters should guess what stimulus was present prior to awakening was not successful: rater 1 matched 13 dreams correctly and rater 2 matched 15. Given that guessing randomly would yield on average 14 correct guesses (33.3% of 40 reports), this is a chance finding.\n\nDiscussion\nOverall, the findings indicate that olfactory stimuli were processed by the sleeping brain and affect the emotions but were not incorporated explicitly into dreams. This is compatible with the model of specific processing of olfactory stimuli within the brain, i.e. the direct anatomical connectivity to the amygdala (Gottfried, 2006). Direct incorporations as reported by Trotter et al. (1988) or for other stimulus types (see Introduction) were not found, thus indicating that olfactory stimuli are processed differently to other sensory modalities on higher brain levels.
